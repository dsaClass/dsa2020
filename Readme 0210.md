# P0210: 4 Values whose Sum is 0

## 描述

The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d) ∈ A x B x C x D are such that a + b + c + d = 0. In the following, we assume that all lists have the same size n.

## 输入

The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000). We then have n lines containing four integer values (with absolute value as large as 2^28) that belong respectively to A, B, C and D.

## 输出

For each input file, your program has to write the number quadruplets whose sum is zero.
